# Professional Apologies That Rebuild Trust

A professional apology is not a performance. It is a clear acknowledgment of impact and a path forward. The best apologies are concise, specific, and calm.

## The three-part apology

1. **Acknowledge** what happened.
2. **Own** the impact or gap.
3. **Outline** the next step.

Example:

> I missed the timeline we agreed on. I know that created extra pressure for you. I will deliver the updated version by 3 PM today.

## What to avoid

- Long explanations that feel defensive.
- Vague statements like "sorry if this caused issues."
- Promises you cannot keep.

## The role of warmth

Warmth matters in apologies, but too much can feel insincere. One grounded sentence is enough:

> I appreciate your patience while I correct this.

## Keep the request separate

If you need something from the other person, separate it from the apology. That prevents the apology from sounding transactional.

## Use a reflective check

Before sending, analyze how the apology might land. Reflxy helps you see if the message feels clear, warm, and low risk without rewriting your words.
