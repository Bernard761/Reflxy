# De-Escalation Language for Written Messages

When tension is high, your words can either cool things down or keep the heat. De-escalation language is direct, calm, and specific.

## A simple de-escalation pattern

- **Name** the tension without blaming.
- **Clarify** your intent.
- **Offer** a path forward.

Example:

> I can see this is frustrating. My goal is to resolve it quickly. Here is the next step I propose.

## Phrases that calm the room

- "I want to understand what you are seeing."
- "Let us align on what success looks like."
- "If I missed something, I want to fix it."

## Phrases that add fuel

- "This is not my problem."
- "You always do this."
- "I already told you."

## Keep the focus on the future

De-escalation is about the next step, not the last mistake. Offer a clear next action and a time window.

## Run a quick impact check

Reflxy helps you spot when a message might increase risk or feel colder than you intend. It is a reflective lens for tense moments.
